## Aim
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should efficiently handle different types of customer queries while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. This experiment demonstrates how various prompting methods can guide structured chatbot development.

## Algorithm / Prompting Techniques

### 1. Direct Instruction Prompting
Objective: Provide clear, concise responses based on simple instructions.
Example Prompt: When a customer asks about their order status, respond politely: "Your order is currently being shipped and should arrive soon. Thank you for your patience!"

### 2. Contextual Prompting
Objective: Use previous conversation details to generate relevant responses.
Example Prompt: If the customer previously mentioned a delay, reply: "I understand your delivery has been delayed. Let me check the latest update and resolve this for you."

### 3. Persona-Based Prompting
Objective: Craft responses with personality to create friendly communication.
Example Prompt: Respond as a cheerful support agent: "Hello! 😊 I’m here to help you. Tell me what issue you're facing and we’ll fix it together!"

### 4. Few-Shot Prompting
Objective: Show example responses to train similar outputs.
Example Prompt:
Examples:
"My wifi disconnects frequently." → "Try restarting your router and checking cable connections."
"My device won’t turn on." → "Charge it for 20 minutes and try a force restart."
Now respond to: "My app keeps freezing frequently."

### 5. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Objective: Solve complex queries through step-by-step reasoning.
Example Prompt:
Steps to solve laptop slow performance:
1. Check if many heavy applications are open.
2. Suggest closing unused apps.
3. Ask whether system updates are pending.
4. Recommend restarting the system.
Now solve: "My laptop fan is making a loud noise."

### 6. Instruction with Constraints
Objective: Respond within limits such as word count and tone.
Example Prompt: Provide responses under 40 words and avoid technical terms.

### 7. Reflective Prompting
Objective: Repeat the customer query before responding to avoid misunderstanding.
Example Prompt: If they ask "How do I change my password?", reply: "Just to confirm—you want to reset your password, right? Here are the steps..."
